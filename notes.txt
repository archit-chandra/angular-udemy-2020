# Creating New Project
ng new my-first-project-assignments

# Adding Bootstrap
npm install --save bootstrap@3

# How Angular app gets loaded and started

index.html: <app-root>Loading...</app-root> - served single page
main.ts:
        bundled scripts imported by CLI at runtime - convenience function
        first code executed

	app.module.ts
		app.component.ts: selector: 'app-root'
			app.component.css
             app.component.html

# Creating new component with CLI and nesting component
ng generate component servers
ng generate component servers --spec false

# Component selectors
1. Element selector: selector: 'app-servers'
2. Attribute selector: selector: '[app-servers]'
3. Class selector: selector: '.app-servers'

# Data Binding
1. String Interpolation: {{...}} - 'String'/String reference/Method returning String
2. Property Binding: [property] = "data" - boolean/boolean reference/Method returning boolean
3. Event Binding: (event) = "expression" - expression is usually a handler method
4. Two way Binding: [(ngModel)] = "data"

- Property and Event binding can be done on:
        i.   HTML elements  - native properties and events
        ii.  Directives - custom properties and events
        iii. Angular created components - custom properties and events

# Directives
- are instructions in the DOM
- can be with/without template

- ngIf
        structural, so used with (*)
        *ngIf="data" - boolean/boolean reference/Method returning boolean


# Debugging
- Use Sourcemaps
